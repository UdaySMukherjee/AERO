                    This allows for a customizable monitoring experience tailored to different environments and pollutants of interest.
                </p>
                <h4>3.3. Sensor Accuracy:</h4>
                <p>The project supports the use of up to 16 sensor modules simultaneously, enhancing the accuracy of measurements. 
                    Users can select from a range of gas sensors, including those for ozone, methane, butane, carbon monoxide, LPG, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen, among others.
                </p>
                <h4>3.4. Portability:</h4>
                <p> Unlike traditional air monitoring systems that are often bulky and stationary, our project focuses on portability. 
                    The compact size of our device enables users to easily transport and install it in various locations, expanding its accessibility and usability.
                </p>
                <h4>3.5. Web Application:</h4>
                <p>We have developed a user-friendly web application that allows individuals to configure their sensor modules. 
                    Users can choose specific ports on the main hub to connect their desired sensors, enabling a seamless integration process. 
                    The web application also provides graphical representations and gas meters to visualize the air quality data collected by the system.
                </p>
                <h4>3.6. Data Storage:</h4>
                <p>To ensure comprehensive data analysis and historical tracking, we provide server space for users to store air quality data collected by the system. 
                    Users can access this data for a considerable amount of time, enabling long-term analysis and trend identification.
                </p>
                <h4>3.7. Alert System:</h4>
                <p>Our monitoring system is equipped with an alert system that sends audio notifications and emails to users when hazardous gases exceed their permissible limits. 
                    This immediate notification helps users take precautionary measures, evacuate if necessary, and respond promptly to potential dangers.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Benefits and Applications</h2>
